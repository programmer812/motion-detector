# motion-detector

This project consists of two programs:

- motion_sensor.py
  - This program will detect movement with a PIR sensor and take pictures/send emails accordingly
 
- flask_app.py
  - Navigating to the /check-movement endpoint of this flask server will show the user the latest picture that was taken and can be used as a way to analyze results
